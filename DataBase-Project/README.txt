Data Base Project

This Project was created for an Intro to Databases Course.
The project utilizes nodejs/express and MySQL to simulate a "shop" or inventory as part of a CRUD application

This is a Project that was initally performed with partner Ronald Nieves.
All sql work was done as a team and checked with each other before submission.
Additional work was done by myself as to practice HTML/CSS.
